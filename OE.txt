Billie at 13: makes awesome music videos Me at 13(now) : closing my laptop slowly to see when the screen turns off
Billie at 13: singing this masterpiece beautifully   Me at 13: having fake arguments in the shower
I listened to this 7 years ago, and now, every time I listen, I cry.
We praise Billie for being 13 when she sang this but can we show appreciation for Finneas only being 17 when producing and writing this 💕
Still can’t believe Billie was only 13 years old when she made this.
We should also appreciate FINNEAS for writing this song and producing it when he was 16!
Her voice can&#39;t be explained in words she is amazing  Such a relaxing voice ♥️♥️
Billies brother: supports her helps her write songs and helps her get famous  My brother: punches me in the face for no reason
SHE WAS 14 IN THIS VIDEO Me as a 14yr old: lazing around and binge listening to her.
Billie at 14: making amazing songs  Everyone else at 14: writing comments like this one
The song expresses deep love for someone who is mysterious and complex, with eyes that hold so many emotions, making her feel weak in front of him. Despite her deep admiration for him, this love also brings sadness and confusion, as if she is drowning in the ocean of his emotions without being able to control it.  Honestly, Billie truly excelled in this song. 😭❤️‍🩹
It’s crazy to think this is what started her whole career
14 years old - she is going places  Me at 14 - watching her getting famous and sleeping
Billie Eilish ...    I am lost in your ocean eyes  
Been listening to this song for months on spotify, didn&#39;t realize she was only 15 holyshit
Billie:   singing about ocean eyes   Also Billie:   has the perfect ocean eyes   💙
THIS is what happens when you have parents who support your passions and push you to do better.
February 23rd 2025, this song will forever be so good and never die 😍
Guys she was 14 when she recorded this song let that sink in. edit:half of y’all are saying 13 and the other half is saying 14 I said 14 at first but then a bunch of you guys started saying 13 so I’m just keeping it at 14.
She has Ocean Eyes ❤
Billie at 14: releases good song Me at 14: digs nose intensively My dad at 14: climbing over mountains, Swimming and running 10 miles in 5 minutes to get to school
My 13 yr. Old niece introduced me to this beautiful song, I&#39;m over 65 yrs. Has a ring of 70&#39;s nostalgia.👍
Billie at 14: standing still in one place and singing Billie now: STARTS DOING CARTWHEELS AND HANDSTANDS ALL OVER THE FLOOR
Why are there so many people in the comments, comparing their lives/accomplishments to Billie&#39;s successful career;   we all have different paths...  
she&#39;s my literally my age here doing this stuff and i&#39;m in 8th grade slowly dying from the stress of my history project.
Personally for me this is her best tune by far ,the raw emotion  🖤 gets me every time
It’s crazy how she was 14 in this. And hi from quarantine.
I&#39;M SO PROUD OF HER!
its been 6 years, but this is still, by far, one of my favourite songs by billie ❤️
37 yr old male finally giving in to her  music .   So soothing 😅
Billie at 13: Has a song that goes globally popular  Me at 13: making sure that 4+5=9 in a Calculator
  a bop has entered the chat  
I&#39;m obsessed with all the songs she sings😭💛!!
"As an 17-year-old straight male, I can confirm the homies do not know I’m listening to this.
 This song is awesome."
Billie Eilish at 13 - making great music.  Me at 13 - Afraid of flushing the toilet at night.
Lyrics  I&#39;ve been watchin&#39; you for some time Can&#39;t stop starin&#39; at those ocean eyes Burning cities and napalm skies Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes Your ocean eyes No fair You really know how to make me cry When you gimme those ocean eyes I&#39;m scared I&#39;ve never fallen from quite this high Fallin&#39; into your ocean eyes Those ocean eyes I&#39;ve been walkin&#39; through a world gone blind Can&#39;t stop thinkin&#39; of your diamond mind Careful creature made friends with time He left her lonely with a diamond mind And those ocean eyes No fair You really know how to make me cry When you gimme those ocean eyes I&#39;m scared I&#39;ve never fallen from quite this high Fallin&#39; into your ocean eyes Those ocean eyes Da, da-da, da-da Da-da-da, da, da Da, da, da, da, da-da-da-da Mm Mm Mm No fair You really know how to make me cry When you gimme those ocean eyes I&#39;m scared I&#39;ve never fallen from quite this high Fallin&#39; into your ocean eyes Those ocean eyes
This girl is going to become the biggest artist in the world
Her voice in this song does something to me❤
Can’t believe this was 5 years ago.. time flies..
This is probably Billie Eilish&#39;s most innocent song...
Billie at 13: making songs and getting famous Me at 13:   *trying to balance the light switch*  
Can&#39;t stop listening to it... It makes me cry... Such deep meanings... Real love and a fear of it... Running from yourself... Giving up and loss of something real - that&#39;s what this song is about.
remember when billie eilish made this song with absolutely no clue she was about to become one of the most famous female singers on earth?
Y’all complaining about she’s 13-14 here while you’re 16-19 right now... GUYS, I&#39;M 25! 💔
Within the hour(s) I&#39;ve been watching Billie&#39;s videos, I&#39;ve seen so many sides to her.
This song brings me back to the world. How I miss such songs (( The song touches my thoughts, cleanses my soul.It&#39;s been so many years, but I still find peace on this song, it keeps all my memories alive. I&#39;m grateful to you, beautiful Billie Eilish💙
Billie at 14: do songs Me at 14 : thinking about skipping school tomorrow
SHE WAS ONLY FOURTEEN FOR 24 HOURS WHEN THEY FILMED THIS CAN WE GIVE A STANDING OVATION FOR THE QUEEN PLEASE
Billie Eilish at 13: started making music   Me at 13: when i turn off the lights of the kitchen and then run fast so the demon won&#39;t catch me
嫌なことがあった日、この曲を聞いたら必ず涙が出てしまう、
Finally a celebrity crush on someone my own age.
I&#39;ve been watchin&#39; you for some time Can&#39;t stop starin&#39; at those ocean eyes Burning cities and napalm skies Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes Your ocean eyes  No fair You really know how to make me cry When you gimme those ocean eyes I&#39;m scared I&#39;ve never fallen from quite this high Fallin&#39; into your ocean eyes Those ocean eyes  I&#39;ve been walkin&#39; through a world gone blind Can&#39;t stop thinkin&#39; of your diamond mind Careful creature made friends with time He left her lonely with a diamond mind And those ocean eyes  No fair You really know how to make me cry When you gimme those ocean eyes I&#39;m scared I&#39;ve never fallen from quite this high Fallin&#39; into your ocean eyes Those ocean eyes  Da, da-da, da-da Da-da-da, da, da Da, da, da, da, da-da-da-da Mm Mm Mm  No fair You really know how to make me cry When you gimme those ocean eyes I&#39;m scared I&#39;ve never fallen from quite this high Fallin&#39; into your ocean eyes Those ocean eyes

I&#39;m 16 and she is 15 I&#39;m shook wtf she has a good voice
Who’s still listening to the song 2 years later? cuz I am ♥️
U really made me cry when you gimme those ocean eyes 🥺🥺🥺
She was 13 when this came out I can’t get over that
I discovered this song only now and it made me cry. I see myself in you thank you very much. Why I did not take the time to listen to you before 😭
woww i really love this song
I love Billie Eilish , she has some beautiful eyes 🌊👀
My brother used to play this song over and over over a year ago, I had no idea it was Billie Eilish.
Omg your eyes 😍❤️
I just remembered im obsessed with Billie and had to rewatch some of her mvs 😭🤌❤
Billie:   starts her career at 14    Me at 14:   trying to decide whether I should choose vanilla or strawberry ice cream  
Billie at 14: Makes Ocean Eyes  Me at 14: wears blue eyeshadow and pink mascara and spends all her time doing myspace quizzes.
Can&#39;t believe this song is this old already
Still in love with this song ❤
Billie at 14: making legendary music  Me: mommy, can you help me open this can of spaghetti o&#39;s
I just realized that there are people behind the background pushing against it with their hands to make that effect and I&#39;m kinda shook about it
it&#39;s 7 years down the line and I still can&#39;t get enough of this song😩😊❣
Those ocean eyes drives me crazy😕🥺
Billie at 13: Successful Me at 13: Still pushes the door when it clearly says pull
Billie: doing something productive when she&#39;s 14 Me: sleeping and doing nothing all day
For all comments comparing themselves to Billie, damn we are all different and some grow earlier, I&#39;m sure you will all be successful at some point of your life, being famous at the age of 13 or 14 is insanely rare so you shouldn&#39;t expect it happening to everyone. Absolutely no need to ashame yourself on this. We have all been stupid kids, probably playing video games or something like that. At some point we will miss the times we were free and would wish to live as we used to. Never wish to grow fast, time is so precious and we are all amazing and unique! Undiscovered talent or passion, wait for it to arrive and enjoy your time being &lt;3  Edit: A quick side note since some people didn&#39;t understand me correctly: I&#39;m not talking about the comments, we all know they wrote that to get likes. But this comment section actually got me thinking about all the people just staying quiet behind their screens, asking themselves why they are not good enough. But you are good enough &lt;3
This song will forever have my heart.🫶🏻
Billie at 13: making this beautiful masterpiece  Me at 13: closing the refrigerator door slowly so I can see the light turn off

I&#39;m just surprised of the fact that how can someone has such an incredible and mature voice at the age of 13!
It was confirmed that billie elish made this 1 day before her 14th birthday, So she made this when she was 13.

First time hearing her early music. She sang this absolutely amazing
